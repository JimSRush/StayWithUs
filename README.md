# StayWithUs

A prototype game built using C# and the Unity engine (compatible with Unity 5), Maya and Mudbox.

Stay With Us is a game prototype, built around the idea of rewiring a brain from within. It takes place in the inside of someones head, after a traumatic injury. The object of the game is to reconnect groups of neurons to reactivate memories, and eventually wake up the protaganist.
